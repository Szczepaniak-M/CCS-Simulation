# Tempomat


## How to install
1. Download repo, 
2. Initialize virtual environment in it: `python -m venv env`,
3. Run that venv: `source env/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`,
5. To run dev server: `python index.py`

### Dumping pip installations into the file
If you installed new pip dependency you need to allow others to know about it. To do so it is best to save all requirements
in one file, which in this case is named `requirements.txt`. You can do this by typing following command: 

`pip freeze > requirements.txt`
